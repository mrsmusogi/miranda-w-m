<p>As part of LSFF 2025, I curated a sold-out screening at SET Social Peckham featuring five short films that differently represent the relationship between place-making, collective desire, and the ideas that shape the spaces we live, work and socialise in.</p>

<p>I facilitated an an open conversation with audiences and filmmakers after the screening where we discussed our experience of social, cultural and commercial spaces: the impressions they impart on us, the futures they foreclose on and the futures they make seem possible.</p>

<p>I also designed a promotional poster and wrote an accompanying <a href="ruinspdf.html">text</a> for the event.</p>
