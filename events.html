    <h3>Public Intimacies</h3>

    <p>Public Intimacies was a collaboratively curated special events programme hosted at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London for the closing weekend of the London Short Film Festival 2020.</p>

    <p>The programme was an investigation into women's auto-ethnographic practices, focusing on the video diary form. I conceptualised, researched and produced the events with Jenna Roberts.</p>

    <p>The three-day programme featured:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Public Intimacies: Anne Charlotte Robinson's Five Year Diary <br> Short films programmed by Thomas Grimshaw and Jenna Roberts, with an introduction by Daniella Shrier (Another Gaze).</li>
        <li>Public Intimacies: Talking to Myself <br> Short films programmed by Miranda Mungai and Jenna Roberts.</li>
        <li>Public Intimacies: Profession: Documentarist <br> Feature film programmed by Miranda Mungai.</li>

        <li>Public Intimacies: Auto-ethnography as Refusal <br> Presentation by Jemma Desai and Rabz Lansiquot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>With Warmth and Ecstatic Solidarity</h3>

    <p>With Warmth and Ecstatic Solidarity was a virtual special events programme of short documentaries presented at the London Short Film Festival 2021.</p>

    <p>The programme looked at filmmaking from various diasporas and the potential for international solidarity. I moderated a conversation with filmmakers Bircan Birol and Suneil Sanzgiri after the event.</p>
