<h2>Remote Contact is a newsletter about working conditions in arts and culture industries.</h2>	 
<p>
	The aim is to start an honest conversation considering how we build solidarity under increasingly competitive conditions, in an unstable and unsustainable political, economic and social landscape.</p>
	
	<p>I will send short newsletters responding to texts written by cultural and political theorists, philosophers, and radical political activists. They will include anonymous anecdotes from my nearly ten years of experience working in the arts and culture sector, interviews, and links to digital copies of the texts.</p>
	
	<p>This is a "Moderated Discussion List" which means you can respond to these emails, and responses can be sent out to the entire mailing list. The themes, thoughts and reflections in these newsletters offer up a common ground to start a broader discussion.</p>
	
	<p>This newsletter is a hopeful endeavour and an invitation to join me in searching for the potentiality that is latent in these bleak, oppressive conditions of actuality. I hope to steer clear of sending you dispiriting critique.</p>

	<p>The word "contact" is taken from Samuel R. Delany's Times Square Red Times Square Blue. In the second essay of the book he outlines the ideas "networking" and "contact." The arts industries rely heavily on networking - which places us in competition, and rarely delivers on it's promises (more work). Networking is confined to institutions, to taking similar subject positions (usually middle class). Interclass contact relies on encounters in public space. It relies on a confrontation with difference and ambiguity, exercising tolerance and acting with good will. 

	<p>With public spaces dwindling, I am hoping that a mailing list will offer something approximating the conditions available from public space. I don't think there is any replacement for public space, for physically sharing space that is truly accessible to everyone of all classes - but we do what we can with what we have!</p>
