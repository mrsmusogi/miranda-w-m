<h2>Remote Contact is a newsletter about working conditions in arts and culture industries.</h2>	 
<p>
	The aim is to start an honest conversation considering how we build solidarity under increasingly competitive conditions, in an unstable and unsustainable political, economic and social landscape.</p>
	
	<p>I will send short newsletters responding to texts written by cultural and political theorists, philosophers, and radical political activists. They will include anonymous anecdotes from my nearly ten years of experience working in the arts and culture sector, interviews, and links to digital copies of the texts.</p>
	
	<p>This is a "Moderated Discussion List" which means you can respond to these emails, and responses can be sent out to the entire mailing list. The themes, thoughts and reflections in these newsletters offer up a common ground to start a broader discussion.</p>
	
	<p>This newsletter is a hopeful endeavour and an invitation to join me in searching for the potentiality that is latent in these bleak, oppressive conditions of actuality. I hope to steer clear of sending you dispiriting critique.</p>

<p>
	<b> I will be archiving the newsletters on this page, and once it is up and running I'll add some more details
