	<p class="sub"> I am a freelance documentary film curator, events producer, and facilitator experimenting with post-screening discussion.</p>

<p class="sub"> I prioritise creating opportunities for audiences to engage in dialogue with one another as well as with any invited guests. I prioritise finding opportunities to screen films beyond a single festival cycle. </p>

<h3>Next up: Ruins Full of Futures at LSFF 2025</h3>
