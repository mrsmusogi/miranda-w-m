	<p class="sub"> I am a freelance documentary film curator, events producer, and facilitator experimenting with participatory discussion and interactive post-screening engagement.</p>

<p class="sub"> I prioritise creating opportunities for audiences to engage in dialogue with one another as well as with any invited guests. I prioritise fairly remunerating all artists and finding opportunities to screen films beyond a single festival cycle. </p>

<p class ="sub"> My curatorial area of expertise is short documentary film, with a particular interest in experimental, hybrid, and new media works. I produce and facilitate spaces that place inclusivity and accessibility first. </p>
