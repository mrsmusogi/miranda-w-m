	<p>
Freelance documentary film curator and events producer experimenting with radical forms of engagement, using films as tools to precipitate and encourage discussion. I am looking beyond the Q&A and panel discussion in an attempt to create less hierarchical modes of dialogue. I hope to support filmmakers' works beyond a single festival cycle and facilitate equitable spaces for everyone involved. I have a special interest in the intersection of sociality, moving image, and new media.
