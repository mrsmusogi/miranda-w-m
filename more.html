Since 2018, I have been thinking about the position film festivals take in the cycle of film production and exhibition, and as a member of arts industries more broadly. At LSFF, as an introduction necessity, I would thank filmmakers for their work and invite applause for each director in turn whose work featured in the programme. Over time, I started to thank them for their labour, their wilful participation in an undervalued industry. This seemed imperative when my work, which relies on theirs, has been similarly rooted in precarity.

A friend gifted me a copy of <a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/internships/internship-readings/freire-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed.pdf">this</a>.

When I had already been thinking about <a href="http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Towards-a-Third-Cinema-by-Fernando-Solanas-and-Octavio-Getino.pdf">this</a> since reading it during my undergraduate degree.

In 2020, I began to re-orient myself towards as equitable a practice as possible. Equitable for filmmakers and audiences. Things to take note of following the pandemic:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Inflation</li>
    <li>More online more of the time</li>
    <li>Alienation vs. social anxiety</li>
    <li>Deflation in the face of wars, climate change, political irrationality</li>
    <li>General hopelessness without a future within reach</li>
</ul>

<p>
To return to my earlier thoughts, arts organisations still stand opposed to anything like a remedy to these things - and these spaces are stagnating under the pressures of reduced funding, overwork, inequality etc. In a post-pandemic world, with shared post-pandemic pressures, I shifted my focus. My curatorial ethos revolves around dialogue - between everyone in the room and between the film and everyone in the room. I curate film works that offer room for interpretation, and can offer multiple themes for everyone to pick up on, unpick, or relate to some tangentially related topic. I encourage everyone to look at what is said between the lines, discover what is implicit in images.

I’m interested in repositioning artworks so that they have social value. I believe the exhibition context can be an environment for moments of collectivity and curiosity, rather than exclusively a room where individual reflection takes place.
</p>
<p>
I’m interested in moving outside of traditional arts venues, so often tied to a sense of intimidation and dependent on implicit and explicit hierarchies.
</p>
I’m interested in treating films as more than a cultural commodity that is only of interest for a single festival cycle.
<p>
I’m interested in fairly remunerating filmmakers, and supporting all the various building blocks that at the moment, uphold a flawed industry, but when placed in new compositions, create space for something else.

Beyond my CV, I have extensive extracurricular interests and experience. I’ve worked to collectively produce film screenings on a voluntary basis at Deptford Cinema, and with <a href="https://even-norwich.co/">Even</a>. I followed my anger in 2020 and delivered a speech at a <a href="https://youtu.be/dKUtuzS4Nbs?feature=shared">Norwich Supports BLM protest</a>. This led to a year and a half of voluntary work with the Norfolk and Norwich Anti-Racist Network, where I learned a lot about working collaboratively, and learned a lot from conversations with others doing good work in the community. I did one year of a two-year part-time MA at the Centre of Research Architecture, Goldsmiths, where I worked on a project in the Forensic Architecture studio and learned about geo-location, GiS, mapping, and policy related to new build developments. I produced a paper on networked infrastructures (satellites and cables for internet delivery) and hosted a zine-making workshop as part of a group project. I quit the MA for a few reasons, the main reason being financial. I have been relentlessly reading, researching, and thinking critically since starting my undergraduate degree.
</p>

<p>
My thinking and understanding of what I can do with my experience and my interests is always developing, and this will be reflected here. At the heart of all of this is the substantial list of facilitators and teachers I have been learning from, and a love for the sense of potential and empowerment that is possible through dialogue - the indescribable third thing that emerges between two people, which cradles the seeds of hope in something else that can’t be named yet, but begins the process of discovering its name and its use.
